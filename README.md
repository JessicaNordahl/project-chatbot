The task was to creat chatbot with differnt input fields

## The problem
We decided to use a long conditonal statment which deals with different answers.
We declared a variable which checks the number of the question being asked and then responds with the correct conditional statment.

We used basic JS. We started with small steps and used a lot of console.log to understand what exactly is a happening. We had a little trouble understanding the click event and how to access value from it. With more time we would increase the complexity of questions.
