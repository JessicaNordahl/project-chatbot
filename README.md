This project is created by me, Lena Simma & Reinis Kalvins

The task was to creat chatbot with differnt input fields, with HTML5 and JavaScript

## The problem
We decided to use a long conditonal statment which deals with different answers.
We declared a variable which checks the number of question being asked and then responds with the correct conditional statment.
 
We started with small steps and used a lot of console.log, to understand what exactly is a happening. 
We had a little trouble understanding the click event and how to access value from it, but got it to work. 

(With more time we would increase the complexity of questions)
